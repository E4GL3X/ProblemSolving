# 🪶 Welcome to E4GL3’s Nest

Hey there, wanderer! You've landed in the roost of **E4GL3**—where I stash my Codeforces problem-solving spoils. This repo is my personal flight log, filled with solutions (mostly in C++) from countless coding battles.

---

## 🧩 What Is This?

It’s just me, E4GL3, cataloging the victories. These are my hand-crafted solutions—some elegant, some chaotic—but all authentic. Feel free to browse, borrow ideas, or just vibe with the thought process. No frills—just raw, focused problem-solving.

## 📁 Nest Structure

Here's how the chaos is organized:

- **`Prey/`**  
  Where the real action happens. You'll find solutions like `Prey_123A.cpp` or `Hunt_500/A.cpp`. Each one is a takedown of a Codeforces problem.

- **`Scraps/`** *(optional)*  
  Brain dumps, random thoughts, and notes on those frustrating problems that kept me up at night.

- **`Talons/`** *(optional)*  
  Helpful scripts and utilities—think test case generators, custom checkers, or whatever else I’ve crafted along the way.

Each file typically includes:
- A brief comment or problem link  
- My strategy (a.k.a. how I pounced)  
- The code itself

## 🏹 Join the Hunt

This is my territory, but the sky’s wide open:

- **Spot a bug or typo?** Open an issue.  
- **Got a cleaner or smarter solution?** Drop a pull request—I’m always up for sharpening my talons.

## ⚠️ Note

All content here is the result of my own grind, unless explicitly stated. You’re welcome to learn and level up from it, but if you’re still hunting on Codeforces, avoid the temptation to copy. The real growth? It’s in the chase.
