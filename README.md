Yo, welcome to the E4GL3’s nest! This is where I stash my Codeforces problem-solving loot. I’m soaring through challenges on and dropping my solutions here—mostly in C++.

## What’s This?

Just me, E4GL3, and These are my battle-tested solutions—some clean, some wild, all mine. Dig in, steal some ideas, or just vibe with the logic. No fancy feathers, just raw problem-crushing goodness.

## The Nest Layout

- **Prey/**: My kills—solutions named like `Prey_123A.cpp` or `Hunt_500/A.cpp`. You get the drift.
- **Scraps/** (optional): Random notes or brain dumps on problems that made me squawk.
- **Talons/** (optional): Scripts for scratching out test cases or whatever else I cooked up.

Each file’s got the problem link or a quick “what’s this?” comment, my attack plan, and the code itself.

## Join the Hunt

This is my turf, but if you’ve got a sharper beak or a slicker move, hit me up:
- Drop an issue if something’s off.
- Toss a pull request if you’ve got a better strike.

## Heads-Up

All this is straight from the E4GL3’s talons—my own grind unless I say otherwise. Use it to level up, but don’t just copy-paste if you’re still hunting on Codeforces. The thrill’s in the chase, fam.

## Squawk at Me

Wanna chat code or flex your own solutions? Ping me at t.me/C1PH3RxE4GL3 or just screech in the issues tab.

Fly high, code hard!
